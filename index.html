            <p>The key to any recipe is to have the best ingredients money can buy. This recipe makes 12 muffis or 1 9x5" loaf and calls for 3 ripe bananas, 1 cup of brown sugar, 1 large egg, 0.25 cup melted butter, 1.5 cups flour, 1 tsp baking soda and 1 tsp salt. You can add half cup of nuts or chocolate chips to your preference.</p>
            <p>Preheat your oven to 165C (or 329F) and grease your pan with butter. Smoothly mash your bananas and add and combine well your wet ingredients. Next add your dry ingredients and don't overmix. Fold in your nuts or chocolate chips and add to your pan and bake for 30-40 minutes. Let rest for 15 minutes and enjoy!</p>

            <h2>Baking Fail: How Substitution Led to a Sour Surprise</h2>
            <p><em>October 6, 2024 by Ajonae Flemmings</em></p>
            <img src="bake.png" alt="Blog Post Image" class="blog-img">
            <p>I recently attempted to make my banana bread recipe but found myself without two key ingredients: baking soda and butter. Instead of heading to the store, I substituted baking powder for baking soda and used vegetable oil in place of butter, thinking they would work just fine. After mixing the batter and baking it, I pulled out a loaf that looked dense but otherwise normal...or so I thought.</p>
            <p>Once I tasted it, the bread was both sour and hard. I later realized that baking soda and baking powder are not direct substitutes, and using too much baking powder caused the sour taste. The oil also didnâ€™t provide the same moisture that butter does, resulting in that dense texture. It was a reminder that some baking substitutions need a bit more caution. Lesson Learned!</p>
